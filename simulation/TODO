CAPSTONE
	1. generate synthetic data
		1.3 generate imu reading
			1.3.2 generate accelerometer readings
			1.3.3 generate gyroscope readings
			1.3.-2 check timestamp works
			1.3.-1 write csv

	2. feed synthetic data to kalibr
		2.1 get real camera intrinsics and write to make_pinhole_camera (aov?)
		2.1 make bag

	3. color splines by error at that point

	4. refactor Board class to include board_dim and boarder points
	5. refactor Extrinsics to handle transformations
	6. refactor trans_vec to be 3x1
	4. try make kalibr not model bias
	5. Read ethz tech report
	6. write verification kalibr
	7. fix bug with capturing empty stuff
