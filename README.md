# AllAbtCamCalib
2016 Spring 16823 course project  
In this project, we aim to explore the following questions:  
1. What gives a good camera calibration with standard Zhang's calibration method? - see 'simulation'  
2. How can we improve on the current camera calibration routine to reduce target imperfection and control point detection imprecision? - see 'calib'  
3. How precise need a camera calibration be to make AR or 3D reconstruction results based on the calibration result convincing? What is 'good enough'? - see 'application'
